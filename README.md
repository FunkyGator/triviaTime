# triviaTime

Plays a very basic game of trivia.

The main menu options are:
1. Start a new game
2. See the Hight Score
3. Exit

Option 1 will take you to the Category select menu.  Here you can choose what trivia category you want.

1. Animals
2. History
3. Geography
4. Random Category

Pick the category you want or select Random Category to have the game randomly pick one of the three categories.

After picking a category you will be taken to the questions.  There are five questions per round.  Pick an answer and press ENTER.
You will then be told if you have the right answer or not.

After answering 5 questions you will be told if you set a high score and then taken back to the main menu.

Option 2 will display the high score.

Option 3 will exit the game.

This was a project that I came up with to test some of my newly learned Python skills.
Some of the skills I used were While loops, if statements, defining functions, and loading a csv file into a list.
